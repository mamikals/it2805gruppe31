      <p> Header: A title, the author names, and date.</p>

    <div class="">
      <p> Administrative Details: The name of your client, and his or her position in the organization.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <p>Purpose, goals, and audience: A summary paragraph to remind the reader
         about the purpose, goals, and audience of your website. Make it brief and succinct.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <p>Page Layout and Appearance: A description of design decisions that are universal to your site.
        You should specify in writing the fonts (types and sizes), the color scheme
        (for text, background, links, shadows, borders, etc.), navbar position in the page
        and its appearance, banner, footer, the social icons bar, or background images
        (if any of them is applicable). In addition to the textual description of these elements,
        you should include a mockup image of this generic page that has only these common
        elements and no other content. Finally, you should describe how these universal design
        decisions fulfill certain goals of the website and its audience.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <p>Content: This is the longest section of your document. For every page,
        you will need to give a text description of the content of the page as
        well as an image of the mockup of the page. The text describes what goal(s)
        this page fulfills, and how design decisions specific to it contribute into
        fulfilling such goals. The reason why you should describe thecontent is that
        you might not have yet received the actual content from the client and in
        your mockup of the page, you will be using fake text, fake images, etc.
        While the content can be fake, you should try to use meaningful headings
        and captions to convey its meaning. Finally, </p>

      <p> Minimum Requirements: The website must include four distinct JavaScript applications
        (for example, rollovers effects on images or menus, user-defined functions, form validation, animations etc.).
        The four applications must all be different from each other. Clearly, indicate how each of you will be
        fulfilling these minimum requirements. Please note that each of these items must be constructed entirely
        by you and not copied from external websites on the Web (though you can modify the code from our
        class materials). Once you fulfill the minimum requirements with your own code, you are allowed
        to get the code from the web (with source attribution) to incorporate certain advanced components
        (e.g. image galleries with transitions), but they will not count as part of the minimum requirements.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <p>Plan: Provide a clear, specific description of your plan for building the site.
        Outline the tasks to be accomplished, the deadlines for those tasks, and who is responsible for them.
        Include a list of files and folders, which will help each partner link to files her partner has built.
        Include a complete list of everything you need to get from your client (text, pictures, sound, etc.)
        and when you expect to get them. To the greatest extent you can, try to have all of these things by
        the time your design is done so that nothing will delay your coding.</p>
